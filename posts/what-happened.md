I get this question a lot, and I wondered why too.

Have you also had the feeling when you are so caught up by your long list of daily tasks that the big picture of your journey becomes blurry? 

So, before going into my 6th year at UBC, I sat down and reflected on what happended in the past five years in an effort to plan the next eight months and answer this question in case I get it again (very likely!).

Top reasons:
1. Coming from a low-income family, I became financially independent once I entered UBC. I took intern/full-time positions between study terms to save up and worked part-time during study terms.
2. I did, in a total of, 21 extra credits of business, math, and CS courses on top of my 132-credit combined major, which would usually take five years already on its own.

Here's a timeline of what happened in the past five years and my plan for the next eight months.
