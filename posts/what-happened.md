I get this question a lot. Here's a timeline of what happened in the past five years and my plan for the next eight months. 

Top reasons:
1. Coming from a low-income family, I became financial independent once I entered UBC. I took intern/full-time positions between study terms to save up and held part-time jobs during study terms.
2. I did, in a total of, 21 extra credits of business, math, and CS courses on top of my 132-credit combined major.
