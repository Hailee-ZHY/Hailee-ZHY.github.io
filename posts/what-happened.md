I get this question A LOT. Here's a timeline of what happened in the past five years and my plan for the next eight months. 

The top reasons:
1. Coming from a low-income family, I became financial independent (e.g., paying for my education and living expenses) once I entered UBC. I took full-time positions between study terms to save up and held part-time positions during study terms. Thankfully, I was able to find field-related jobs on campus as I became more senior, which allowed me to apply my knowledge and made time-management a lot easier.
2. I did, in a total of, 21 extra credits of business, math, and CS courses on top of my 132-credit degree.
