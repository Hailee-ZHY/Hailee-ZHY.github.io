I get this question a lot, and I wondered why too.

Have you also had the feeling when you are so caught up by your long list of daily tasks that the big picture of your journey becomes blurry? 

So, before going into my 6th year at UBC, I sat down and reflected on what happended in the past five years in an effort to plan the next eight months and answer this question in case I get it again (very likely!).

There are two reasons: I did coop for **almost two years**, and my combined major usually takes five years to finish.
1. In the past six years, I completed five four-month CS coop terms at three different places, ranging from academia to non-profit to the industry. While studying full-time, I had also taken on part-time positions varied from retail to administrative to teaching. These experiences collectively helped me shape my interests and learn that I am most motivated by the real-world impact my work makes.
2. I did extra math, and CS courses on top of my combined major. Having the Combined Major of Business and CS means that I am graduating with the same CS degree requirement as UBCâ€™s core CS majors with additional mandatory business courses.

Here's a timeline of what happened in the past five years and my plan for the next eight months.
