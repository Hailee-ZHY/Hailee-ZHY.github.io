# Another Annotated Example of CS PhD Statement of Purpose 

This post is inspired by the Statement of Objective examples provided by the [MIT EECS Communication Lab](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/eecs/commkit/graduate-school-personal-statement/). Some programs (e.g., Berkeley) require a Statement of Purpose (SoP) and a Personal Statement (PS). In this post, we will dissect and annotate [my SoP](https://eugenielai.github.io/docs/application/SoP_MIT_eylai.pdf) submitted to MIT EECS, which is a hybrid of both, in my case. 

I would also like to shamelessly include a copy of [my first draft](https://eugenielai.github.io/docs/application/SoP_draft_eylai.pdf) for a before-after comparison and show how far I have (and maybe anyone could) come by applying the learnings discussed in this post. It would be difficult to measure the impact of something without showing the starting point, which is often missing in the existing resources for SoP. 

Also, if you are an anxious applicant, let’s not compare ourselves. I know it’s easier said than done, and I still fall into that trap too. But it is **unfair** to compare the ins and outs of ourselves to **only** the best side of others (e.g., their SoP). This note was first brought up to me by Prof. [Maria De-Arteaga](https://mariadearteaga.com/) back in 2019 when I just started to pivot my profile towards grad school and has been helping me get off the overthinking treadmill since. 

## Before We Start

Intended audience: Future and current CS PhD applicants. 

The role of SoP in grad applications: Touched on by [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/fadeladib/status/1353020079257038848?s=20), which could be specific to MIT EECS. 

My result: I applied to 8 programs and was fortunate to get in almost everywhere, with 5 offers (i.e., Berkeley, MIT, UBC, UMich, and UW) and 3 withdrawals (i.e., Columbia, NYU, and Maryland). 

A non-exhaustive list of caveats that may make the takeaways in this post not as applicable so readers’ discretion is advised:
* I applied during a pandemic and am not sure how that affected my experience. 
* I only applied to programs in the US and Canada so the experience is subjective to the system here. 
* I’m in data systems so please always question if the content is field-specific. 

Motivation to (uncomfortably) put myself out there: 
* Writing crystallizes my learning and is a skill I’m working on. The pressure helps me practice. 
* The thought of potentially helping someone trumps the fear of being judged. 
* I got so so much help and support for my application and just want to give back. 

Speaking of support, a list of help I received for my SoP:
* I was privileged to be assisted by the [MIT GAAP](https://www.thrive-eecs.mit.edu/gaap) and [Berkeley EAAA program](https://twitter.com/ermgrant/status/1316111464273502211?s=20). My mentors, [Xuan](https://twitter.com/xuanalogue) and Gabe, provided extremely valuable feedback on my SoP. 
* A big thank you to my labmates and my research parent, Prof. [Rachel Pottinger](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rap/), who offered both helpful comments and emotional support. 
* I was also privileged to get help from the [Writing Centre](https://ubcca.mywconline.com/index.php?logout=YES) and [Student Service Centre](https://students.ubc.ca/) at my undergraduate university (i.e., UBC). 
* Just to reiterate, the examples by the [MIT EECS Communication Lab](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/eecs/commkit/cvresume/) are helpful. Many other programs (e.g., CMU) provide such examples too. 
* I was also influenced by these YouTube channels. 

So the first takeaway is clear: **Be resourceful.** Ask around. Keep an eye out for opportunities and resources, which shouldn’t take up much energy. Just have that running in the background. 

## Detailed Comments

> Statement of Objectives

Openning with questions is one of the more interesting ways to grab the reader's attention, instead of a laundary list of who I am and what I do.
> How can we propagate breakthroughs in the scientific community to the real world? With the explosion of big data, how can we help fields outside of computer science (CS) extract and leverage its value? Inspired by these questions, my current research focuses on facilitating user interaction with databases. 

## Overall Thought Process

Things I constantly reminded myself of when thinking about my SoP at a high level. 

**Help the reader focus.** This point has multiple layers, but we will list two here. First, every sentence is an opportunity to signal the reader and should together portrait a cohesive image. We don’t want to waste any bits or distract the reader with noise so every word should have its place. Second, only include relevant experiences… 

**Find a common thread and tell a story about my professional development.** What to include? What’s relevant? Convey my why’s (e.g., why research, why grad school, why data systems).

**Throw out the timeline.** How to organize my content? It is ok to break the chronological order of my experiences if that makes my story more logically sound. We don’t simply learn from experiences but rather from reflecting on the experiences. Sometimes I acquire the experience first, and then the ah-ha moment comes maybe months later when I encounter something else and connect the random dots. 

**Be quirky, not cliche.** I tried to bring in my personal voice while staying professional and make every sentence read like something only I would write. It’s a fine line to walk. But it’s possible to allow my personality to shine through the story of my professional development. The annotated SoP is (trying to be) an example. So is this post. 

## Other Takeaways

Other things I learned and applied. 

**Just start writing.** It is an iterative process. The first draft is the hardest and almost guaranteed to suck, but it gets our brain going. It gets a lot easier once we gain the momentum and just have to make incremental changes. 

**Start early**, which goes hand-in-hand with the last point. I wanted to leave ample time for that interactive process, finished my first draft in late August, and finalized it in the first week of December 2020. I feel grateful that I took the time to reflect on my why’s, which also came in handy later in the (quite intense) interview process in January 2021. 

**Don’t stress too much about tailoring the SoP to each program.** Partial thanks to SIGMOD ‘20\*, I had a general research direction when applying. The programs and labs I applied to may have nuances in their research interests and strengths, but my motivation, research interests, and skillsets didn’t need to change much. I only swapped out the second half of the future work section for each program. However, someone with a broader interest and a more diverse set of programs may want to customize the SoP more and have different answers for each why depending on the program. 

\* Note: More on [my experience at SIGMOD ‘20](https://eugenielai.github.io/posts/sigmod-takeaways.html). 

**Read each program’s prompts and formatting requirements carefully.** The point above is about the content, while this one is about the format. The requirements all have slight differences (e.g., word limits, header, title) so just be aware. 

**Choose what feedback and advice to take in.** Going back to the point of being resourceful, we may later find ourselves getting various or even conflicted advice from different sources, which can be confusing and overwhelming. My apologies if this post is making it worse. But I always ask myself two questions whenever I get feedback from people, just for a quick sanity check: 
* Do they know the field? 
* Do they know me? 

## Last Words

Through the process, I had countless breakdowns moments where I felt that I had already tried everything, but my SoP just read shallow, and my writing would never be good enough.

But it’s because SoP is hard to write!! It not only demands writing techniques but also deep reflections of our why’s from our experiences. Although this learning experience challenged me hard on both fronts, I’m glad that I took the time and saw it as an opportunity to grow: It reminded me that improving my writing is a never-ending process, and the reflections indeed made me question my life but also assured my decision to pursue graduate studies. 

However, I do want to acknowledge that not everyone has the privilege to afford the time and energy. Further, if we consider our individual profile (e.g., GPA, LoRs) as a whole, pouring our limited resources into SoP alone may not be a strategic move. Nothing is perfect nor needs to be. So knowing when to say good enough is an important skill too (which is something I need to work on too). 

Lastly, taking one step further, I also find some of the takeaways (e.g., help my reader focus, just start writing) transferable to other written pieces (e.g., papers) or professional development (e.g., be resourceful) in general. 

I genuinely hope this post is somewhat helpful to at least one other person on the planet, and very best of luck if you are applying soon!! <3
