My test post.

## Takeaways

Through this experience, I have the following takeaways:
* Reformulating an ill-defined problem: the intention of the visualization tool wasn't clear at the start. Sometimes the clients don't even know what they want and whether what they want would actually solve their problem. 
* The power of combining experts' knowledge and data analytics motivates my research interest.
* Resistance and tech adoption: how to measure if an IT project is successful? how to make a tool more adoptable? Provide support, instead of making decisions for the users without showing the reasoning.
