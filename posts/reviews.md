# My Take on Causal Inference: Assessing Online Platform’s Policy Impact on Review Manipulation  
Date: 2020-04-12

Out of pure curiosity, I did a PhD-level business course this term on causal inference. This post is a light-hearted version of my course project, advised by [Dr. Arslan Aziz](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/people/arslan-aziz). This is my first exposure to research in social science. Although everything felt very different, I learned that I get motivated by the quatifiable impact of my work on a real-world problem.

## The Problem
Online retailing is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the past decade. However, studies have shown that unnatural reviews take up nearly a third of total online reviews, and review manipulation is shown to have substantial impacts on consumer’s buying decisions. Hence there is a growing need to monitor, assess, and control the quantity and impact of unnatural reviews on online platforms.

The three main types of unnatural reviews are:  
* Negative reviews by competitors
* Positive reviews by producers
* Incentivized reviews by customers

As a method of review manipulation, incentivized reviews are posted by consumers who received incentives from the product seller for the purchased product. Some common incentives include free products, product discounts, promotion coupons, and cash backs.

Historically, Amazon has prohibited compensation for reviews but allowed businesses to incentivize their customers to share their “honest” opinion as long as the reviewers disclosed their affiliation with the business in their review text. Although, in theory, these reviewers could write their unbiased opinion on the product, studies have shown that these incentivized reviews have tended to be overwhelmingly biased in favour of the product being rated. 

In an effort to keep bias out of the review process, on October 6, 2016, Amazon announced to ban all incentivized reviews across the platform, which provides a natural shock as an exogenous variation that only directly affects incentivized reviews. Here I aim to examine whether review policy bans can reduce review manipulation on online platforms by answering:  
* **Question:** Did the ban on incentivized reviews have an impact on review manipulation? Specifically, did the ban change the nature and number of incentivized reviews?
* **Hypothesis:** After the policy ban, there are more incentivized reviews. In addition, the characteristics of incentivized reviews also become more similar to natural reviews'.

I will be using a difference-in-difference approach with fixed effects to capture the impact of the policy ban on incentivized reviews.
