I got a bit sad that SIGMOD is over now. I loved every bit of the experience! There is a fraction of my learnings from this experience.

I know the field of databases better and have a more clear idea of my research interests.
* **Before SIGMOD:** I felt that I was only doing research in my little room, focusing on a specific problem. I read papers on schema exploration, query recommendation, and provenance summarization. But to me, they were independent islands scattered around a huge canvas that’s covered in mist.
* **After SIGMOD:** I have a better understanding of the rough subtopics in databases and how my problem fits in a bigger picture. 

I want to work with my research crushes no matter where they are.
* **Background info:** I’m applying to grad school this year.
* **Before SIGMOD:** When I considered where to apply to, “school ranking” was a big factor, second to research fit. I was sure that I’m interested in the user side of database systems but would still seriously stretch my research interests just to apply to a prestigious school.
* **After SIGMOD:** Research fit becomes the only thing that matters. I associate people with the cool stuff they do, everything else goes away. Specifically, seeing a variety of work presented in the [HILDA workshop](https://hilda.io/2020/) triggered me to think, “This is exactly what I want!” Now I can only see myself applying to places where our interests match. 

I think of you as my cousin/uncle/auntie next door. 
* **Before SIGMOD:** My nervousness hinders how I interact with people, especially when I try to impress them, or when they’re a lot more senior than me. My brain blacks out. 
* **During SIGMOD:** Still an issue. But thanks to Gather, I found that it became easier for my personality to come through when I was oblivious to who I was talking to, or when I was so carried away by my curiosity and burning questions.
* **After SIGMOD:** Still unsolved. But as an intermediate step, I want to (with respect) think of you as my cousin/uncle/auntie next door to help myself focus on the conversation and come up with questions. 

I went into the conference thinking, “I’ll milk this till the bitter end.” I think I did the best I could! No regrets.
