## Bio

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in the Combined Major of Business and Computer Science (BUCS) program at the University of British Columbia (UBC). I am currently a full-time research assistant at the UBC Data Management and Mining Lab, supervised by [Dr. Rachel Pottinger]. 

My current research focuses on databases while applying concepts of visualization, machine learning, and HCI to help users interact with and make sense of data. Today, database systems provide a vital infrastructure to access high volumes of data in a variety of applications. However, both field-specific and database-related expertise is required for a user to interact with such database applications. This need of users sparks my urge to offer help. Hence my work seeks to make data more accessible for users with a database-related incomplete skillset.
